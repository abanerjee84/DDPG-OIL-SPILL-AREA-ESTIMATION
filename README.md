A gym like simulation environment for Oil Spill area Estimation with Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning is presented here.

DDPG is used to train a swarm of 5 UAV (simulated) to encompass ans estimate an Oil Spill of area nearly 4k.m^2. 

Framework : Pytorch

Additional Requirement: netCDF4,numba,pygame
